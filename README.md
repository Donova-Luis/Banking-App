## Application Architecture

### Component Structure

- **App Component**: Main router and application wrapper
- **DashboardPage**: State management and data fetching logic
- **Dashboard**: Presentation component for the main interface

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Smart/dumb component pattern
2. **React Router**: Proper routing with navigation between pages
3. **Material-UI Integration**: Consistent design system
4. **Form Handling**: Controlled components with validation
5. **Mock Data**: Sample user and transaction data for demonstration

### Mock Data

The application currently uses mock data including:
- User information (name, account number, balance)
- Sample transaction history
- Placeholder functionality for deposits and transfers

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: This is a demonstration application with mock data. In a production environment, you would need to implement:

- Authentication and authorization
- Secure API endpoints
- Data encryption
- Input validation and sanitization
- HTTPS/SSL certificates
- Session management
- Fraud detection
- Audit logging

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Real-time transaction processing
- [ ] Account statements and downloads
- [ ] Bill payment functionality
- [ ] Mobile app version
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Customer support chat
- [ ] Investment portfolio tracking
- [ ] Budget planning tools
